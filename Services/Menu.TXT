The are two types of menu documents (so far)

# Main Menu (MainMenu, MoreMenu)
# Next Menu (NextMenu)

The specific documents are specified in Model.Install().
We can either use the defaults or specify model specific
menu documents.

The main menu has a next button and the next menu has
a previous button.

The main menu has an onLoad call because it must refresh
the options content after loading.
