<p>
This is the home page for a library of special
purpose mathematical models.

<p>
These models use differential and algebraic
equations to describe dynamic processes. Solutions
are calculated while advancing the independent
variable, which is usually time.

<p>
The results are presented as numerical values and
in several different graphical formats.
