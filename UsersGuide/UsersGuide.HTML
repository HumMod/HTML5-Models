These are the basic steps used to calculate the solution
of any of the models in the Modeling Workshop.

<p>
<b> The Model's Solution. </b> Most models in this workshop
have time as the independent variable. Solutions are
calculated and displayed as a function of time. You obtain
the desired solution by advancing the independent variable
time.

<p>
<b> Controlling The Solution. </b> You control the solution
using the buttons near the top of any Solve panel. There is
typically one panel named Solve - Summary, but there can be
more.

<p>
<select>
  <option>1 Second</option>
  <option>2 Seconds</option>
  <option>4 Seconds</option>
</select>

To advance the solution select an appropriate advance time
from the drop down menu.

<p>
<input
   type = "button"
   value = "Go"
>

Then click the <i>Go</i> button. The solution will advance the
specified amount of time and will automatically stop when
done.

<p>
<input
   type = "button"
   value = "Restart"
>

Click the <i>Restart</i> button to restart the solution. All
variables (including time) will be reset to their intial
values. The graphs will be cleared.

<p>
<input
   type = "button"
   value = "Overlay"
>

Click the <i>Overlay</i> button to get a restart
without clearing the tracings on the line graphs.
Using this feature, you can create multiple, overlayed
solutions.
