<p>
The differential equation introduced in Overview is

<p class='Indented'>
   (1) dY/dX = - K * Y

<p>
with Y0 being the initial value of Y.

<p>
Equation (1) can also be expressed as an
integral equation.

<p class='Indented'>
   (4) Y = <img src="../../Services/SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(dY/dX) dX

<p>
in conjunction with

<p class='Indented'>
   (1) dY/dX = - K * Y

<p>
The exact solution to Equations (4) and
(1) is

<p class='Indented'>
   (5) Exact_Y = Y0 * exp (-K * X)

<p>
The error in the calculated solution is

<p class='Indented'>
   (6) Error = Exact_Y - Calculated_Y

<p>
As noted, this is one of the few differential
equations that has an exact solution. For all
others, numerical solution is required.
