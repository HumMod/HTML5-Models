<p>
DE is a contraction of differential equation.

<p>
The dependent variable here is Y and the independent
variable is X.  The equation is

<p class='Indented'>
   (1) dY/dX = - K * Y

<p>
with Y0 being the initial value of Y.

<p>
K is known as the rate constant. The qualitative
aspects of the solution depend on the value of
K.

<ul>
<li> When K is zero, Y doesn't change.
<li> When K is positive, Y goes exponentially
to infinity.
<li> When K is negative, Y goes exponentially
to zero.

</ul> 

<p>
When the independent variable is time, the time
constant is the reciprocal of the rate constant.

<p class='Indented'>
   (2) Tau = 1 / K

<p>
When X = Tau, Y = 0.37 * Y0.

<p>
The half-time is the time required for Y to go
one-half way from its initial value to its final
value.

<p class='Indented'>
   (3) t<sub>1/2</sub> = 0.69 * Tau

<p>
The exact solution to this equation is

<p class='Indented'>
   (4) Exact_Y = Y0 * exp (-K * X)

<p>
The error in the calculated solution is

<p class='Indented'>
   (5) Error = Exact_Y - Calculated_Y

<p>
This is one of the few differential equations
that has an exact solution. For all others,
numerical solution is required. We will calculate
the numerical solution for this equation and
compare it to the exact solution.
