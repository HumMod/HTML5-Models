<p>
The house cools down, the thermostat clicks the
furance on.  The furnace heats the house. The
thermostat clicks off.

<p>
The temperature inside a house is directly
proportional to the amount of heat in the house.
The amount of heat is the integral over time
of the net accumulation of heat in the house.
Net accumulation is the difference between heat
added by the furnace and heat lost to the
outside world.  The furnace is controlled by
a thermostat.

<p>
The independent variable is time in minutes.
