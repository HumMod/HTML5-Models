<p>
The Hodgkin-Huxley equations describe
the genesis of an action potential.
Membrane potential is a function of
the charge separation across the
membrane and membrane capacitance.
Charge separation is the integral
over time of current flowing through
the membrane.  Current is the sum of
sodium, potassium and leakage (other
ions) ion currents.  Each of these
currents is a function of membrane
potential and ion conductances.  The
conductances are voltage sensitive.

<p>
The independent variable is time in
milliseconds.

<p>
Membrane charge is the integral over
time of membrane current.  Membrane
potential is a function of membrane
charge and membrane capacitance.

<p>
Sodium channels can be active or
inactive.  Active channels may be
open or closed.  Open channels
determine the sodium conductance.
Inactive channels are closed.

<p>
The size of the pool of active
channels and the transition delay
between active and inactive states
are both voltage dependent.

<p>
If all sodium channels are active
and open, conductance will be 120.

<p>
The fraction of active sodium channels
that are open and the transition delay
between open and closed are both
voltage dependent.

<p>
Potassium conductance is determined
by open potassium channels.  Opening
is voltage dependent and there is a
voltage sensitive delay in the
transition.

<p>
Equilibration potentials are a
function of intra- and extracellular
ion concentrations.  These potentials
are parameters here.  Ion currents
are a function of equilibrium
potentials and conductance.
