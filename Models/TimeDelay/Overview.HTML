<p>
A disturbance is not initially propagated from
input to output.  As time passes, the output
gradually increases to equal the input.

<p>
A time delay is defined by

<p class='Indented'>
   dOutput/dt = K * (Input - Output)

<p>
K is the rate constant of the time delay.  The
time constant (Tau) of the delay is the reciprocal
of the rate constant.

<p class='Indented'>
   Tau = 1 / K

<p>
For a step change in input, when time = Tau,
Output = 0.63 * Input.

<p>
The half-time of the step response is the time
required for the output go one-half way to its
final value.

<p class='Indented'>
   t 1/2 = 0.69 * Tau
