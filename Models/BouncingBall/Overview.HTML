The ball is released above a hard surface.  It
accelerates downward until it strikes the surface.
Then, velocity reverses as a function of its
elasticity and it bounces back up again.

<p>
Distance is the integral of velocity
over time while velocity is the integral
of acceleration over time.

<p>
This model is two-dimensional.  Acceleration,
velocity and distance are described using
vertical and horizontal components.

<p>
Horizontal acceleration is zero.  Horizontal
velocity is the integral of horizontal
acceleration, and it should be constant.  Horizontal
distance is the integral of horizontal velocity.
Thus, we have two differential equations in the
horizontal direction.

<p>
Vertical acceleration is produced by gravity and
is constant.  Vertical velocity is the integral
of vertical acceleration while vertical distance
is the integral of vertical velocity.  Thus, we
have two differential equations in the vertical
direction.

<p>
The ball is elastic.  It reverses velocity
when it hits the ground.
