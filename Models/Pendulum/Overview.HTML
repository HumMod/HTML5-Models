<p>
A pendulum accelerates downward gaining
momentum.  After it passes the bottom, it
loses momentum and slows, then it stops and
reverses direstion.

<p>
Of interest: A pendulum oscillates at a regular
interval.

<p>
Since the trajectory of a pendulum is restricted
to an arc on a circle, use of polar coordinates
is appropriate.

<p>
Acceleration for this pendulum in the y direction
is gravity.  The length of the pendulum influences
its dynamics.

<p>
Angular velocity is the integral over time of
angular acceleration. The angular position of the
pendulum is the integral over time of its angular
velocity.
