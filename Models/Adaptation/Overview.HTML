A disturbance is initially propagated from
input (I) to output (O).  As time passes, the
output gradually returns to its previous value.

<p>
Adaptation is defined by

<p class='Indented'>
   dA/dt = K * O
<br class='Indented'>
   O = I - A

<p>
The first equation can also be expressed as

<p class='Indented'>
A = <img src='../../Services/IntegralSign.BMP'> K * O dt

<p>
K is the rate constant of the time delay.  The
time constant (Tau) of the delay is the
reciprocal of the rate constant.

<p class='Indented'>
   Tau = 1 / K

<p>
For a step change in input, when time = Tau,
O = 0.63 * I.

<p>
The half-time of the step response is the time
required for the output go one-half way to its
final value.

<p class='Indented'>
   t 1/2 = 0.69 * Tau
