<p>
High glucose concentration in the extratracellular
fluid stimulates insulin release by the pancreas.
Insulin, in turn, stimulates cellular uptake of
glucose.  Low glucose concentration inhibits
insulin secretion and stimulates hepatic release
of glucose.

<p>
This model is scaled to a 70 kG adult.

<p>
The independent variable is time in minutes.

<p>
The quantities of glucose and insulin in the
extracellular fluid volume are the integrals over
time of their net rate of change.  Glucose
concentration is reported in G/dL.

<p>
We have a glucose pump and an insulin pump.  Each
has a switch and setting.  When the switch is on,
the infusion rate is equal to the setting.
