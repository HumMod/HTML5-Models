<p>
Two differential equations track the head counts for the
moose and wolf herds.

<p>
First, the basic moose population dynamics. Equations (1) to
(5) refer to moose.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(1) Count = <img src = "../SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(Change) dX

<br>
(2) Change = Birth Rate - Death Rate

<br>
(3) Birth Rate = Fertility * Count

<p>
Moose fertility is a parameter.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(4) Fertility = 0.1

<br>
(5) Death Rate = Mortality * Count

<p>
Moose mortality is not a parameter. We'll get to
that shortly.

<p> But first, the basic wolf population
dynamics. Equations (6) to (10) refer to
wolf.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(6) Count = <img src = "../SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(Change) dX

<br>
(7) Change = Birth Rate - Death Rate

<br>
(8) Birth Rate = Fertility * Count

<p> Wolf fertility is not a parameter. It will be
defined below.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(9) Death Rate = Mortality * Count

<p>
Wolf mortality is a parameter.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(10) Mortality = 0.2

<p>
We need two additional concepts before wrapping up:
moose food value and wolf hunting skills.

<p>
Moose food value is a parameter that defines the
amount of benefit that a wolf gets from a moose
kill.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(11) Moose Food Value = 0.1

<p>
Wolf hunting skills is a parmater that determines
how many moose kills can be expected for a given
wolf population.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(12) Wolf Hunting Skills = 0.002

<p>
The two remaining definitions are for moose
mortality and wolf fertility.

<p>
Moose mortality is a function of wolf hunting
skills and wolf herd size.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(13) Moose Mortality
<br><span style="margin-left:30px;">= Wolf Hunting Skills</span>
<br><span style="margin-left:30px;">* Wolf Count</span>

<p>
Wolf fertility is a function of moose food value,
wolf hunting skills and moose herd size.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(14) Wolf Fertility
<br><span style="margin-left:30px;">= Moose Food Value</span>
<br><span style="margin-left:30px;">* Wolf Hunting Skills</span>
<br><span style="margin-left:30px;">* Moose Count</span>
