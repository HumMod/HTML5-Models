<p>
This is the Predator-Prey Model. Wolves are the
predators and moose are the prey.

<p>
This model starts with some ordinary population dynamics
... and then it gets interesting.

<p>
The moose herd size (head count) is the integral over
time of the moose birth rate minus the moose death rate.

<p>
The wolf herd size (head count) is the integral over
time of the wolf birth rate minus the wolf death rate.

<p>
Birth rates are the product of a fertility factor and
herd size.

<p>
Death rates are the product of a mortality factor and
herd size.

<p>
Now here is where it gets interesting. We add in predation.
Wolves kill the moose and eat them. This has two important
effects.

<ul>

<li> Predation increases wolf fertility as a function of
moose food value, wolf hunting skills, and the size of the
wolf herd.

<p>
<li> Predation increases moose mortality as a function of
wolf hunting skills and the size of the wolf herd.

</ul>

So the end result is that while wolves are increasing
their fertility factor, they are also decreasing their
food supply. The model illustrates that this is a very
unstable relationship.
