<p>
This is a basic model of circulatory system function.
The model includes

<ul>

<li> Both peripheral and cardiac contributions to cardiac
output.
<li> The peripheral contribution involves blood volume,
mean circulatory filling pressure, resistance to venous
return and right atrial pressure.
<li> The cardiac contribution involves heart strength
and right atrial pressure.
<li> Basic fluid balance involving salt and water intake
and renal salt and water excretion.
<li> Peripheral autoregulation of blood flow.
<li> Arterial pressure is a function of peripheral vascular
resistance and cardiac output.
 
</ul>
