<p>
A mass is suspended by a spring.  The forces
acting on the mass are due to gravity and the
distension of the spring.

<p>
Pull the mass down, let it go, and it will
oscillate up and down.

<p>
The independent variable is time.

<p>
The resting length of the spring is the length at
which it produces no force.

<p>
The force produced by the spring is the product of
its stiffness and distention from resting length.

<p>
The mass's upward acceleration is equal to spring
force divided by mass minus the acceleration of
gravity.

<p>
The velocity of the mass is the integral over time
of its acceleration. The position of the mass is
the integral over time of its velocity.
