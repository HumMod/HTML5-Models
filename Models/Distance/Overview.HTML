We're shooting the shotput.  The idea here
is to find the angle (from horizontal) that
makes the shotput go the greatest distance
-- at a constant initial velocity.

<p>
Distance is the integral of velocity
over time while velocity is the integral
of acceleration over time.

<p>
This model is three-dimensional.  Acceleration,
velocity and distance are described using
vertical and horizontal components. The third
dimension is time.

<p>
There is a little bit of trigonometry involved
in that we must find the initial values for
vertical and horizontal velocity as a function
of the shotput initial velocity and angle (from
the horizontal).

<p>
The horizontal acceleration is zero.  The
vertical acceleration is gravity, or -9.8
m/sec<sup>2</sup> at the earth's surface.
