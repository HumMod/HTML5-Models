<p>
This is the Epidemic Model. The model shows how an
epidemic can grow to involve an entire population,
while beginning with a small number of infected
individuals.

<p>
The population consists of three types of individuals

<ul>

<li> Individuals not infected and never infected. This
is the healthy group.
<p>
<li> Individuals now infected. This is the contagious
group.
<p>
<li> Individuals who were infected and who are now
immune or dead. This is the recovered group.

</ul>

<p>
Here are the basic rules

<ul>

<li> Individuals in the contagious group can infect
individuals in the healthy group but not individuals
in the recovered group.
<p>
<li> When healthy individuals are infected, they
transition to the contagious group.
<p>
<li> Individuals in the contagious group gradually
transition to the recovered group.

</ul>

<p>
The contagion rate is a function of virulence, the
contagious head count and the healthy head count.

<p> The recovery rate is a function of the contagious
head count.
