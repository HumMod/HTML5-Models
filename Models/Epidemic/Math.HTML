<p>
Three differential equations track the head counts for the
healthy group, contagious group and the recovered group.
All three variables represent number of individuals in the
group.
<ul>

<li> H = Healthy Head Count
<li> dH/dX = Healthy Change Rate 
<p>
<li> C = Contagious Head Count
<li> dC/dX = Contagious Change Rate
<p>
<li> R = Recovered Head Count
<li> dR/dX = Recovered Change Rate

</ul>

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(1) H = <img src = "../../Services/SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(dH/dX) dX
<br>
(2) C = <img src = "../../Services/SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(dC/dX) dX
<br>
(3) R = <img src = "../../Services/SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(dR/dX) dX

<p>
A parameter is available to set the initial size of the
contagious group.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(4) C(0) = 5

<p>
The contagion rate for this epidemic depends the head
counts for the healthy and contagious groups and on
the virulence of the contagion. The units for virulence
are 1/Person-Day.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(5) Virulence = 0.001
<br>
(6) ContagionRate = Virulence * H * C

<p>
The recovery rate for this epidemic depend on the
contagious head count and the recovery speed. The
recovery speed units are 1/Day.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(7) RecoverySpeed = 0.1
<br>
(8) RecoveryRate = RecoverySpeed * C

<p>
We now have enough information to calculate the rates of
change for the three groups.

<p style="margin-left:12px;">
(9) dH/dX = - ContagionRate
<br>
(10) dC/dX = ContagionRate - RecoveryRate
<br>
(11) dR/dX = RecoveryRate
