<p>
A low-pass filter will smooth an oscillating
signal by attenuating higher frequency
oscillations while passing lower frequency
oscillations.

<p>
This model is a first-order, low-pass filter
which is implemented by the first-order
differential equation

<p class='Indented'>
   dOutput / dt = K * (Input - Output)

<p>
The independent variable is time.

<p>
We define a low-frequency sinusoid (Signal)
and a high-frequency sinusoid (Noise).

<p>
This model (Low-Pass Filter) uses a high
frequency sinusoid to represent noise, while
a companion model (Noise) uses white noise
to represent noise.

<p>
The cutoff frequency of the filter defines
the filter's performance.  Signals with
frequencies less than the cutoff frequency
will pass through the filter while signals
with higher frequencies will be attenuated.
