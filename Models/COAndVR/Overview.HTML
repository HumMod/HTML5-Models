<p>
On the average, cardiac output and venous return are
equal.  Each is determined by a unique set of factors.

<p>
Cardiac output (CO) is determined by the right atrial
pressure (RAP), heart strength (HS), and shape of the Frank-
Starling curve.

<p class='Indented'>
   (1) CO = f (RAP) * HS

<p>
Venous return (VR) is determined by right atrial
pressure (RAP), mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP)
and the resistance to venous return (RVR).

<p class='Indented'>
   (2) VR = (MCFP - RAP) / RVR

<p>
We assume that cardiac output (CO) is equal to venous
return (VR).

<p class='Indented'>
   (3) CO = VR

<p>
So here is the challenge.

<ul>
<li> Use a value of RAP to calculate CO in Equation (1).
<li> Use the some value of RAP to calculate VR in
Equation (2).
<li> Have the values of CO and VR satisfy the equality
in Equation (3).
</ul>

There is more on this in the Math document.
