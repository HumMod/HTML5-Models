The challenge was outlined in the Overview document.

<p>
We have cardiac output (CO) as a function of right atrial
pressure.

<p class='Indented'>
   (1) CO = f (RAP) * HS

<p>
I'll rearrange Equation (2) to get right-atrial pressure
(RAP) on the left-hand side. Now we have RAP as a function
of venous return (VR). 

<p class='Indented'>
   (4) RAP = MCFP - VR * RVR

<p>
It is likely that cardiac output (CO) will never be exactly
equal to venous return (VR) as specified in Equation (3).

<p class='Indented'>
   (3) CO = VR

<p>
So we'll change the rules a bit and say that we have
a solution when CO is nearly equal to VR. That is

<p class='Indented'>
   (5) | VR - CO | &lt;= Error Limit

<p>
The absolute value brackets indicate that we don't
care about the sign of the error. We only care about
the magnitude of the error.

<p>
The model uses an implicit algebraic equation solver
to do all the work. I arbitrarily set the error limit
at 10.0. You'll notice when using the model that the
difference between CO and VR is alway 10 or less.

<p>
The calculation sequence is as follows.

<ul>
<li> Begin with a trial value of VR.
<p>
<li> Use Equation (4) to calculate RAP as a function
of VR.
<p>
<li> Use Equation (1) to calculate CO as a function
of RAP.
<p>
<li> Use Equation (5) to compare VR and CO. If the
absolute value of the difference is less than the
error limit, we have a solution. If the difference
is greater than the error limit, pick a better value
of VR and repeat these steps.

</ul>
