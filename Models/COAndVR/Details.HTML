Here is a list of the CO-And-VR model's variables. Note
that the model is not solved as a function of time. It
has no differential equations.

<p>
<b>Cardiac Output (CO)</b> is the rate of blood flow from the
heart to the periphery. Units are mL/Min.

<p>
<b>Venous Return (VR)</b> is the rate of blood flow from the
periphery back to the heart. Units are mL/Min.

<p>
<b>Right Atrial Pressure (RAP)</b> is the blood pressure in
the right atrium. Units are mmHg. This is a key variable in
that it influences both cardiac output and venous return.

<p>
<b>Mean Circulatory Filling Pressure (MCFP)</b> is a virtual
pressure that pushes blood from the periphery back to the
heart. Think of it as a functional venous pressure. Units
are mmHg.

<p>
<b>Resistance To Venous Return (RVR)</b> is a virtual hemodynamic
resistance that opposes the flow of blood back to the heart. It
is roughly equivalent to venous resistance. Units are mmHg/(mL/Min).

<p>
<b>Heart Strength (HS)</b> is a parameter that moves the plateau of
the Starling curve up and down. Units are x Normal.

And we have one curvilinear function called Starling Curve
which relates cardiac output (CO) to right atrial pressure
(RAP).

<p>
The curve's data points are shown as red circles above and
are tabulated below.
