<p>
This is a model of a simple circulatory system and
a kidney. The kidney excretes salt and water as a
function of perfusion pressure. The kidney also
secretes renin, again as a function of perfusion
pressure.

<p>
The kidney has an effect on blood pressure through
extracellular fluid volume. The kidney also has
an effect on blood pressure through renin and its
effect on vascular resistance.
