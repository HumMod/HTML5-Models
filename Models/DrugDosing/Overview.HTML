<body>

Watch the concentration of drug build
up over time with repeated dosing.

<p>
A medicine is taken N times a day. The
medicine is continuously degraded in
proportion to the total amount in the
body.  The concentration in the body
is a time-dependent function of both
dosing and degradation.

<p>
The independent variable is time in days.
