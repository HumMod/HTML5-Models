<p>
The Windkessel Model has one differential equation that
states that the Windkessel volume (Volume) is the integral over
time (X) of the change in volume (Change).

<p class='Indented'>
(1) Volume = <img src = "../../Services/SmallIntegralSign.BMP">(Change) dX

<p>
Note that the change variable is the derivative of volume
with respect to the indepedent variable or dVolume/dX.

<p>
The volume's rate of change (Change) is equal to the rate of
inflow (Inflow) minus the rate of outflow (Outflow).

<p class='Indented'>
(2) Change = Inflow - Outflow

<p>Ventricular pressure (VP) has a maximum value (VPMax) and
is the positive part of a sine function of time (X). Periodicity
is determined by heart rate (HR). 

<p class='Indented'>
(3) Arg = 2 * Pi * (HR / 60) * X<br>
(4) VP = positive VPMax * sine (Arg)

<p>
Windkessel (aortic) pressure (Pressure) is a function of the
Windkessel's blood volume (Volume), vascular compliance (C)
and unstressed volume (V0).

<p class='Indented'>
(5) Pressure = (1 / C) * (Volume - V0)

<p>
The Windkessel's rate of blood inflow (Inflow) is equal to the
valve conductance (VC) multiplied by the pressure gradient. The
pressure gradient is ventricular pressure (VP) minus Windkessel
pressure (Pressure). Back flow is not allowed in this initial
rendering.

<p class='Indented'>
(6) Inflow = VC * (VP - Pressure)

<p>
The Windkessel's rate of blood outflow (Outflow) is equal to the
peripheral conductance (PC) multiplied by the pressure gradient. The
pressure gradient is the Windkessel pressure (Pressure) minus
the peripheral pressure (PP).

<p class='Indented'>
(7) Outflow = PC * (Pressure - PP)
