<p>
This is the Windkessel Model. The model demonstrates the
generation of pulsatile arterial pressure in response to
pulsatile ventricular outflow.

<p>
<b>The Blood Vessel.</b> The model is build around an
elastic arterial compartment - the Windkessel. The
compartment has a compliance (C) and an unstressed
volume (V0). It generates blood pressure in response
to blood volume changes.

The term <i>Windkessel</i> is German. Its means roughly
<i>air container</i>. The important concept here is that
it is the elastic properties of an artery that determine
how much pressure a given volume will generate.

<p>
<b>Blood Flow.</b> The Windkessel receives blood flow from
the ventricle through an aortic valve and in turn delivers
blood flow to the periphery through a vascular conductance.

<p>
Blood flows at any instant in time are equal to the product
of the pressure gradient and vascular conductance.

<p>
<b>Blood Volume.</b> Blood volume is the integral over time
of the blood inflow from the ventricle minus the blood
outflow to the periphery. The blood volume is calculated
using a differential equation.
