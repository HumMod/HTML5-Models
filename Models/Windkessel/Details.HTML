<p>
Time (X) is the model's independent variable. Units are
seconds.

<p>
Windkessel blood volume (Vol) is the volume of blood in
the Windkessel compartment (mL).

<p>
Inflow (In) is the rate of blood inflow (mL/Sec) into
the Windkessel compartment.

<p>
Outflow (Out) is the rate of blood outflow (mL/Sec) from
the Windkessel compartment.

<p>
Windkessel pressure (Pressure) is the pressure (mmHg)
generated by the blood in the Windkessel compartment.
Pressure is a function of blood volume, vascular
compliance and unstressed volume.

<p>
Vascular compliance (C) is the compliance (mL/mmHg) of the
Windkessel compartment. Compliance can be thought of as
elasticity.

<p>
Unstressed volume (V0) is the largest blood volume that does
not generate a pressure.

<p>
Ventricular pressure (VP) is the pulsatile pressure (mmHg)
that generates Windkessel inflow.

<p>
Maximum ventricular pressure (VPMax) is the maximum value
(mmHg) of ventricular pressure.

<p>
Heart Rate (HR) is a parameter that determines the periodicity
of ventricular pressure.

<p>
Valve conductance (VCond) is the vascular conductance
((mL/Min)/mmHg) of the valve in the Windkessel's inflow
tract. Vascular conductance is the reciprocal of
vascular resistance. If the Windkessel represents the
aorta, then this valve is the aortic valve.

<p>
Peripheral (or venous) pressure (PP) is the pressure
(mmHg) opposing Windkessel outflow.

<p>
Peripheral conductance (PCond) is the vascular conductance
((mL/Min)/mmHg) between the Windkessel and the periphery
or veins.
